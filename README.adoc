== NOTICE

[[notice-2023-january]]
*2023-January-17*:

At the end of 2022, VMware https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/spring-for-vmware-gemfire-is-now-available[announced]
the general availability of the Spring for VMware GemFire portfolio of projects.

While these Spring based projects for VMware GemFire are open source and a succession to the Spring for Apache Geode
projects, they are not a replacement. VMware GemFire forked from the Apache Geode project and is not open source.
Additionally, newer Apache Geode and VMware GemFire clients are not backwards compatible with older Apache Geode
and VMware GemFire servers. You can begin the transition by starting https://docs.vmware.com/en/Spring-Data-for-VMware-GemFire/index.html[here].

Alternatively, the Spring portfolio provides first-class https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/io.html#io.caching.provider[integration]
with other comparable caching providers. Also, see https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#cache-store-configuration[here]
and https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#cache-plug[here].

Finally, keep in mind, the Spring for Apache Geode projects will still be maintained until OSS and commercial support
ends. Maintenance will only include CVE and critical fixes. No new features or major enhancements will be made.
The Spring Data for Apache Geode support timelines can be viewed https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-geode#support[here].

[[notice-2022-october]]
*2022-October-24*:

As of Spring Data `2022.0.0-RC1` (_Turing_-RC1) / `3.0.0-RC1`, the _Spring Data for Apache Geode_ (SDG) module
has been removed from the Spring Data BOM and Spring Data release train. SDG will no longer continue in
the `3.0` generation from this point forward.

In summary, VMware (VMW) made a https://markmail.org/message/oafksl5iufmqhuyg[decision] to discontinue all contributions
to the Apache Geode project at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). VMware has committed to the Apache Geode project
until the end of October 2022. However, the plan is to transition the Apache Geode project responsibilities to another
entity or group of individuals who are members of the PMC and are willing to maintain and manage the project going
forward.

Unfortunately, as of 2022-October-24, the Apache Geode project failed to secure at least 3 voting members on the PMC
required to maintain and manage the project. So, a https://markmail.org/message/dfdkfmxcawcl4q7r[VOTE] was cast to move
the Apache Geode project to the Attic at the Apache Software Foundation. Clearly, this puts the _Spring Data for
Apache Geode_ (SDG) project at odds with the Apache Geode project, especially with respect to
https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-geode#support[support timelines].

_Spring Data for Apache Geode_ (SDG) `2.7.x` is already GA and based on Apache Geode `1.14.x`. Across the Spring
portfolio there was no plan for a Spring Data `2.8` and a subsequent Spring Boot `2.8` to pick up Spring Data `2.8`.
SDG `2.8` would have been the earliest opportunity to build support for Apache Geode `1.15`
(See https://geode.apache.org/releases/[releases]).

Since Spring Data / Spring Boot `2.7` are the last minor releases in our `2.x` release series, SDG `3.0` was then
immediately targeted for Apache Geode `1.15`. Although, given VMW's decision, we decided to cancel SDG `3.0` because
it would extend our support timelines significantly past the October 2022 date committed to by VMW. As a result, support
for Apache Geode `1.15` was going to move into an extended SDG `2.8` release and proceed with a series of milestones
and release candidates leading up to a final `2.8.0` GA in a relatively compressed timeframe.

Now that this https://markmail.org/message/dfdkfmxcawcl4q7r[VOTE] has been cast, we have changed our decision
and the Spring team will no longer proceed with SDG `2.8`. In addition, although we will honor our SDG project
commitments and https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-geode#support[support timelines], where SDG `2.7.x` OSS EOL
ends on 2023-May-05 and commercial EOL ends on 2024-Sept-01, the SDG project will now go into minimal maintenance
mode where only CVEs and critical bugs will be addressed. No new features or enhancements to the SDG project will occur.

Finally, VMW has intentions of resurrecting the _Spring Data for VMware GemFire_ (SDG) https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-gemfire[project],
which will become the eventual successor of the _Spring Data for Apache Geode_ project. However, _Spring Data for VMware GemFire_
will be managed as an external, community-led project. _Spring Data for VMware GemFire_ will not be included in
the Spring Data BOM, will not be released as part of the Spring Data release train and will not be maintained by
the Spring (Data) team any longer.

Specifics of the _Spring Data for VMware GemFire_ project and timeframe are beyond the scope this notice, but more
details will be provided in a blog post in the near future.

== Code of Conduct

This project is governed by the https://github.com/spring-projects/.github/blob/e3cc2ff230d8f1dca06535aa6b5a4a23815861d4/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[Spring Code of Conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code of conduct. Please report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Getting Started

Here is a quick teaser of an application using Spring Data Repositories in Java:

[source,java]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, Long> {

  List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);

  List<Person> findByFirstnameLike(String firstname);
}

@Service
public class MyService {

  private final PersonRepository repository;

  public MyService(PersonRepository repository) {
    this.repository = repository;
  }

  public void doWork() {

    repository.deleteAll();

    Person person = new Person();
    person.setFirstname("John");
    person.setLastname("Blum");
    repository.save(person);

    List<Person> lastNameResults = repository.findByLastname("Blum");
    List<Person> firstNameResults = repository.findByFirstnameLike("J*");
 }
}
----

Configure a Pivotal Geode cache and Region (REPLICATE, PARTITION and so on):

[source,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:gfe="http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire"
	xmlns:gfe-data="http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/gemfire"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance
  xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/geode https://www.springframework.org/schema/geode/spring-geode.xsd
	http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/gemfire https://www.springframework.org/schema/data/geode/spring-data-gemfire.xsd">

  <gfe:cache/>

  <gfe:partitioned-region id="ExampleRegion" copies="2">

  <bean id="gemfireTemplate" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.GemfireTemplate" p:region-ref="ExampleRegion"/>
	<gfe-data:repositories base-package="com.acme"/>
</beans>

== Reporting Issues

Spring Data uses JIRA as issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please search the
https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAGEODE[issue tracker] to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue doesn’t already exist, https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAGEODE[create a new issue].
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of Spring Data that you are using and JVM version.
* If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use JIRA `{code}…{code}` escapes before and after your text.
* If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. Attach a link to your code or a compressed file containing your code.

== Building from Source

You don’t need to build from source to use Spring Data (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Data can be easily built with the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper].
You also need JDK 1.8.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.5.0 or above].

_Also see link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] if you wish to submit pull requests, and in particular please sign the https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor’s Agreement] before your first non-trivial change._

=== Building reference documentation

Building the documentation builds also the project without running tests.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install -Pdistribute
----

The generated documentation is available from `target/site/reference/html/index.html`.
